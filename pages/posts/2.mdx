It took a bit longer than usual to finish all the chocolates from Christmas this year.

Not that I've gianed any self-control. It's just there was that there was a lot of dark chocolate this time, and it's not as moreish as milk chocolate. This little red panda looks how I feel.

It's been nice to get the paints out. 

It's probably about 20 years since I last used watercolours! 

I'm keeping it simple and not worrying too much about the colours. It's just a nice quick way to give my sketches more substance.
